SBWall-
=======

"The Wall" application. Students share information about on-campus events.

The idea is to have a real time information flow of on-campus happenings using the eyes of the students walking
around campus. For example, if there is free food at the student activities center and you happen to be there, let
everyone know by loading your app, selecting the activities center as your location and posting "Free food at the SAC!"
Whats more, you are even given driving directions to the venue!
